INTEGRA FINANCIAL SERVICES | BECKY HODGES

When we were searching for a janitorial service for our company, Blueox presented us with the best pricing for the best cleaning services. We have been pleased with our decision ever since! The management and the janitorial crew are so easy to work with and really listen to what we like and need for our building. They provide our employees with a clean and nice looking atmosphere that we couldn't be more happy with.

STRATEGIC PLANNING GROUP | LADAWN COBURN

We have used Blueox for two years now, and have been extremely pleased with the quality of their work. They are extremely thorough and efficient, and it's always a pleasure to enter the office after they have been here. We have dark carpet and dark wood which show dirt and dust easily, and with Blueox taking care of things, we have no worries about looking less than perfect. Communication with them is always good. They send a supervisor in every month to inspect our office and note any items that need to be addressed, although there is typically not anything because they do such a good job! If you are looking for a cleaning company that will do a good job, have clear communication and make your life easier, Blueox is the one to hire!
