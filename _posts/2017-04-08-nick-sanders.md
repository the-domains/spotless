NICK SANDERS | PRESIDENT

When I started Spotless of Utah, now Blueox, in 2006, I simply had dreams of paying off my student loan debt. While my company helped that cause, my dreams have evolved tremendously. As president of Blueox, I've become driven to build a company that provides the best janitorial services and customer service experiences for clients nationwide. Through partnering with clients and communities, I'm working to build a company that people respect and love, whether they're working with us as clients or for us as employees.

CHAD ROPER | VICE PRESIDENT

Spoltess is my pride and joy. As vice president of our company, I wholeheartedly believe our success, and our future, will be built on a foundation rooted in trust, value and communication. These are at the heart of everything we do as a company, and they motivate our teams of cleaning specialists, quality assurance personnel and our clients. We strive to make every customer a fan of the services we provide them, and we'll never tire of that mission.

HALEY HILLSTEAD | cleanSPECIALIST

"Working for Blueox is perfect for me because of the flexible evening hours. I also welcome the break it gives me from my studies. The Blueox management team is always willing to help me solve problems, even at very late hours of the night, which makes my job easier and less stressful so that I can focus on ensuring my client's needs are met."
