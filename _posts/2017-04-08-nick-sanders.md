## NICK SANDERS

PRESIDENT

When I started Spotless of Utah, now Blueox, in 2006, I simply had dreams of paying off my student loan debt. While my company helped that cause, my dreams have evolved tremendously. As president of Blueox, I've become driven to build a company that provides the best janitorial services and customer service experiences for clients nationwide. Through partnering with clients and communities, I'm working to build a company that people respect and love, whether they're working with us as clients or for us as employees.
![“I have worked in the cleaning industry for many years, and I know Blueox is the right company for me to align my future with. As a veteran of the graveyard shift, I enjoy being able to perform a detailed job that other people notice the following day. It makes me feel good about what I do!”
